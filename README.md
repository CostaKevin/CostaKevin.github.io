## 📌 About Me

I'm a data-driven researcher with a strong foundation in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistical modeling. My work focuses on applying modern data analysis techniques — such as Gaussian Processes, Neural Networks, and Bayesian inference — to extract insights from complex scientific datasets.

I enjoy building solutions that combine statistical rigor, efficient code, and insightful visualizations to solve real-world problems — especially in physics and observational sciences.
