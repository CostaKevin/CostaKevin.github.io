## 🎓 Academic Experience

**Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), Brazil**

- **Scientific Research in Artificial Intelligence (Aug 2022 – Oct 2024)**
  - Applied machine learning techniques (Gaussian Processes, Neural Networks) to cosmological data modeling.
  - Used Bayesian inference for forecasting and parameter estimation in scientific contexts.
  - Worked extensively with Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn) for data analysis and visualization.

- **Research on Cosmological Distances (Sep 2021 – Sep 2022)**
  - Developed a Python-based methodology using observational stellar data to estimate galactic distances.
  - Utilized libraries such as Astropy and OpenCV in the context of cosmological measurements.

- **Science Outreach & Communication (Oct 2021 – Oct 2022)**
  - Participated in the COSMO-UFES outreach project to promote scientific topics via YouTube (8K+ views).
  - Topics included AI, cosmology, and tech frontiers, in collaboration with the PPG-COSMO graduate program.

- **Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (Sep 2020 – Dec 2021)**
  - Assisted in physics courses (optics, thermodynamics, relativity, etc.) during remote teaching.
  - Used interactive digital tools for tutoring and problem-solving sessions.
